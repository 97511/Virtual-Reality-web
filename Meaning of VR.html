<h7>Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings. 
            This environment is perceived through a device known as a Virtual Reality headset or helmet. VR allows us to immerse ourselves in video games as if we were one of the characters,
             learn how to perform heart surgery or improve the quality of sports training to maximise performance.</h7>

            <h7> Although this may seem extremely futuristic, its origins are not as recent as we might think. In fact, many people consider that one <br> 
             of the first Virtual Reality devices was called Sensorama, a machine with a built-in seat that played 3D movies, gave off odours and generated vibrations to make the experience as vivid as possible.<br> 
             The invention dates back as far as the mid-1950s.Subsequent technological and software developments over the following years brought with them a progressive evolution both in devices and in interface design.

            Jeroen Linner: Some consider him the godfather of virtual reality, who founded VPL Research, began developing and manufacturing some virtual reality devices such as data transfer gloves, which were then sold by Mattel at a price of $ 75.
            Pioneer of virtual reality technology Nicole Stinger: (1989 and 1992) 

Producing the first immersive movie, Angels, the first virtual reality film in today's concept, combines image, sound and touch (via connected gloves) to create a new and distinctive experience.</h7>
